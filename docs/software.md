# Install the software

This step is very simple.

Just copy the code in the [code.py](https://github.com/isacben/picocade/blob/main/firmware/code.py) file and paste it in the `CIRCUITPY/code.py` file in your board.

That's it. Your board should be ready to controll PICO-8. You can test it either with your breadboard prototype or with the soldered circuit connected to the computer.

Enjoy PICO-8 games!
