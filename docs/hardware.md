## Schematics

If you want to lunch the KiCad project, you might need to import the Raspberry Pi Pico KiCad symbol:

- [Download the Raspberry Pi Pico KiCad symbol](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=336825)
- [Import KiCad symbols to the global library](https://forum.kicad.info/t/copying-new-symbols-from-one-project-to-another/36338/4)

Otherwise, this schematic shows the connections:

## Prototyping

You might want to test your circuit on a breadboard:

> **Note**
> At this point, it is a good idea to skip the soldering part and [install CircuitPython](https://github.com/isacben/picocade/blob/main/docs/circuitpython.md) and the [picocade code](https://github.com/isacben/picocade/blob/main/docs/software.md) to test if everything works with PICO-8. Once you pass this test, you can start the soldering.

## Soldering

The final board is just a replica of the circuit in the breadboard:
